**The Problem** <br>
Once you deploy a Smart Contract, Ethereum saves it On-Chain by Bytecode, so the human-readable version can be forgotten. Today we use Etherscan's Servers to upload and validate the readable version of Smart Contracts by a hashes validation. But for some reason, in the long run, Ethereum can continue working as a Blockchain, but the Ethereum Foundation can fail... And if the foundation will fail, we'll lose the Human Readable version of Smart Contracts forever! <br>
**The Idea** <br>
This SOS Dapp is designed to validate Smart Contracts Human Readable version by storing it On-Chain via Base64 and in by its front end to check the hashing validation via the deployed one... The site used ENS and a DFO to be unstoppable forever. <br>
